# opengl-shader-loader
Small library for loading shaders for OpenGL in C

## Philosophy
- Should cover all the basic and standard usecases of using shaders in OpenGL, so you don't have to re-create the standard file-reading and shader compilation code for every project, but can just use this library.
- Should be easy to install and use. If possible, keep it header-only.
