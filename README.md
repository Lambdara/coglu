# coglu - C OpenGL Utilities
Small library with utilities for OpenGL

## Scope
- Loading shaders from files and compiling them into shader programs
- Loading textures from files
- Loading meshes from files
- Other contributions welcome that fit the philosophy

## Philosophy
- Should be easy to install and use. If possible it should be kept header-only.
- The library should cover simple, common and general use-cases that turn up when trying to use OpenGL in C.
